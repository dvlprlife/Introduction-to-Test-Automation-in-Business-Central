# Introduction-to-Test-Automation-in-Business-Central

Design your Dynamics 365 Business Central Test Automation. As you release and update your Business Central application, testing its functionality is important to ensure it works as expected. Testing is an iterative process, and creating repeatable tests that can be automated, will help streamline your development process.

Automated testing in Business Central involves using software to run tests automatically on the system to ensure that it functions as expected. This approach reduces manual testing, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and costly.

Automated testing in Business Central involves creating a set of test cases that simulate different scenarios and use cases. These test cases are then executed automatically and checks the output against the expected results. The results of each test are analyzed to identify any defects or issues.
